# Muvi_Hackathon
The Hackathon was of 12 Hour.
MUVI is a OTT platform where a individual creater can come and make their own application under the banner of Muvi.com.
Muvi provide 3 option of monitising a content publish by a content creater so my Idea was to add one more option which is crowd funding.
The app which I made is a general crowd funding app where a content creater can host is next task and can request a amount of money which is collected by public fund.
(suggestion)Only 30%-40% app will be implemented in Muvi platform.
